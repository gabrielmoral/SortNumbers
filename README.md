# SortNumbers

1.	Allow the user to enter numbers, of any integer value and in random order. 

2.	Sort these numbers in either ascending or descending order â€“ the order should be chosen by the user.

3.	The ordered sequence should be inserted into a database record along with the direction that the sequence was sorted in and the time taken to perform the sort.

4.	Use the Bootstrap template provided to style your application and examples from http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables

5.	Bind the newly inserted record and display the results of the ordering using HTML 5.

6.	Again using HTML 5 display the results of all sorts available for display in either ascending or descending order of time taken and exportable as XML.
